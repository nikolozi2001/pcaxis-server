# 🚀 Dashboard Setup Instructions

## ✅ **Dashboard Fixed!** 

I've fixed the CORS issue and enhanced your dashboard with better error handling and connection management.

## 📋 **How to Use the Dashboard**

### **Option 1: With API Server (Recommended)**
```bash
# 1. Start your API server
npm start

# 2. Open dashboard in browser
http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

### **Option 2: Standalone Mode (Demo Data)**
```bash
# 1. Open the dashboard.html file directly in your browser
# The dashboard will automatically detect it's in standalone mode
# and show demo data with connection instructions
```
